#### Task Routes

1. **GET** `/api/tasks` - Fetch all tasks.
2. **POST** `/api/tasks` - Create a new task.
3. **GET** `/api/tasks/:id` - Fetch a specific task by ID.
4. **PUT** `/api/tasks/:id` - Update a specific task by ID.
5. **DELETE** `/api/tasks/:id` - Delete a specific task by ID.

#### Category Routes

1. **GET** `/api/categories` - Fetch all categories.
2. **POST** `/api/categories` - Create a new category.

#### User Routes (if applicable)

1. **GET** `/api/users` - Fetch all users.
2. **POST** `/api/users` - Create a new user.

### Frontend Routes

Assuming you are using React Router for the frontend, the routes might be structured like this:

#### Main Application Routes

1. **/** - Home page or dashboard.
2. **/tasks** - Display all tasks (rendering the `TaskList` component).
3. **/tasks/:id** - View details for a specific task.
4. **/categories** - Display all categories (rendering the `CategoryList` component).
5. **/categories/:id** - View details for a specific category.
6. **/add-task** - A form for adding a new task.
7. **/add-category** - A form for adding a new category.
